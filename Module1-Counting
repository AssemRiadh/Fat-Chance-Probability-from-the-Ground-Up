Theory:

How many nos: between n and k where n<k: ((k-n)+1)
How many nos: between n and k , divisible by m: ((last no: =< divible by m)- (first no: from n thats divisible by m)) + 1
n=23 k= 283, m= 5 > 56-5 + 1

Multiplication Principle
==========================
No of sequences of length k chose from a collection of n objects: n^k
No of sequences of length k chose from a collection of n objects, without repetion: n*n-1*........*n-k+1  >> nCk n!/(nâˆ’k)!.





Practice:
In a sports stadium with numbered seats, every seat is occupied except seats 33 through 97 >> 97-33 +1
In a sports stadium with numbered seats, every seat is occupied except seats 33 through 97.
Suppose the fans are superstitious and only want to sit in even numbered seats because, otherwise, they fear their team will lose. How many even numbered seats are still available in the block of seats numbered
33 through 97? Choose the best answer. 48-17 +1
Harvard has a 32-digit billing code for all financial transactions at the University, which means there are 10^32distinct billing numbers. For unambiguous record keeping, each financial transaction requires a distinct billing number. Suppose there are 5000

employees at the University, and each employee makes ten financial transactions each day of the year. (For the purposes of this problem, we will ignore the existence of leap years.)
How many distinct billing numbers would Harvard need to use over a period of 400
years (the approximate lifetime of the institution)? Choose the best answer >> 5k*10*365*400 

A course catalog for the Open University of Earth lists classes via a sequence of three numbers (chosen from to ) followed by three letters in English (chosen from A to Z). How many courses can be given unique catalog numbers? Choose the best answer.
10^3 * 26^3

A course catalog for the Open University of the Milky Way lists classes by a sequence of two letters (chosen from A to Z) and four numbers (chosen from 0-9).
How many courses can be given unique catalog numbers? Choose the best answer.
26*26*10*10*10*10

Is this enough to offer five-million courses? yes

How many course numbers are there which have no repeated letters and no repeated numbers?  26*25*10*9*8*7


# 3 digit no with (1-9) but , should be an odd no. How many possible sequences. 
Odd means, last digit(1,3,5,7,9). 3rd digit (5!) , 2nd digit(8!) 1st (7!) --> 8!*7!*5!

Line of 15 students, 8 bouys, 7 girls, no 2 boys should be together. nB>nG . So 1st,3rd....15th position  boys, 8!(B) * 7*(G)

For a positive integer , which is larger n!or n^n ? (Assume that n> 1.) Choose the best answer
correct  n^n

How many three-digit odd numbers are there with no repeated digits? Choose the best answer
So because we're trying to construct an odd number,
there are five possible choices for the last digit--
1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
Now, the trick to solve this problem is to next think how many choices there
are for the first digit, because the first digit does have
to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
It cannot be 0--
then we would not get a three-digit number.

>> 5!8!8!

The Subtraction Principle
===========================
4 letter word with min 1 vowel:

 this subtraction principle,
we know how many words contain at least one vowel--26 to the fourth, the total number of words, minus 21 to the fourth,
the number of words that don't contain a vowel.And tha t works out to 262,495 words that contain at least one vowel.


Of all the seven-letter words in the English alphabet, how many have a letter in them that appears more than once? Choose the best answer.

A phone number has seven digits and cannot begin with a 0. 9*10^6

A phone number has seven digits and cannot begin with a 0.
How many phone numbers contain at least one 7.
? 
9*10^6 - 8*9^6

A phone number has seven digits and cannot begin with a 0.
How many phone numbers contain the sequence  123. 


Evaluation1:
How many whole numbers are there b/n 242 and 783 ? 542

How many whole numbers are there b/n 242 and 783 are divisible by 6? 90

How many whole numbers are there b/n 242 and 783 are not divisible by 6? 542-90

13 athletes from around the world are competing in the steeplechase competition at the 2020 Olympics. By the outcome of the event we'll mean the determination of who gets the gold medal, who gets the silver medal, and who gets the bronze medal.
How many possible outcomes are there?13*12*11

Say that three of the athletes in the steeplechase competition are from Moldovia. (Steeplechase is big in Moldovia, apparently.) How many outcomes involve at least one Moldovian winning a medal?13*12*11-10*9*8

Recall that by a "word" in the English alphabet we mean an arbitrary sequence of letters chosen from the
letters of the alphabet.
How many six-letter words in the English alphabet contain at least one vowel? (For the purposes of this problem, there are five vowels among the
letters of the alphabet). Choose the best answer. 26^6 - 21^6

Recall that by a "word" in the English alphabet we mean an arbitrary sequence of letters chosen from the
letters of the alphabet.
How many six-letter words in the English alphabet have at least one repeated letter? (By a repeated letter, we mean any letter that appears more than once in the word, not necessarily in two adjacent letters.) Choose the best answer.
26-26c6

Consider all numbers consisting of four different digits all between 1 and 9
. How many of these are odd? Choose the best answer. 8*7*6*5
